## Next.js 15 Race Condition Bug

This repository demonstrates a race condition bug in a Next.js 15 application. The `About` page fetches data from an API route that might fail.  Improper error handling leads to unexpected behavior.  The solution demonstrates how to address this using async/await and proper error boundaries.

### Bug Description

The About page fetches data using `fetch`. If the API route fails, the component might have already mounted, leading to an error in the UI.

### Solution

The solution implements the following changes:

- Uses async/await for cleaner error handling.
- Includes a loading state to inform the user that the data is being fetched.
- Implements error handling with a fallback UI element.
- Demonstrates the use of an error boundary component to gracefully handle runtime errors within the About page.
